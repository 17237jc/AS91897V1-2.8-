        Image Region named after Māori History of each Taumata <br />
        <br />

        The Tararua Taumata is named after the Tararuas Ranges in the lower
        North Island of New Zealand. The Tararua Range was named after important
        Ngāti Toa chief, Te Rangihaeata, to commemorate a peace arrangement
        between the Ngāti Toa and Ngāti Kahungunu tribes. <br />
        <br />The Pukeariki Taumata is named after the West Mountains and Hills
        in the Lower Hutt Region. Puke ariki means the hill of chiefs. It
        represents the site of a Māori pā of Te Āti Awa tribe and the Chief Te
        Rangi-apiti-rua.

        <br />
        <br />The Remutaka Taumata is named after the East Mountain ranges that
        extend in the lower North Island from Wellington to Wairarapa. A Maori
        Ancestor named Haunui-a-nanaia named the mountains Remutaka which means
        ‘remu’ to ‘gaze and look’ and ‘taka’, ‘to sit down’.

        <br />
        <br />The Pukeatua Taumata is named after the Wainuiomata and Waiwhetu
        Hills. It means Hills of the Gods which represents the sacred
        significance and the history of the mountains. The Bridge at the top of
        the Wainuiomata Hill is also named Pukeatua which recognises the
        importance of the hill connecting the Hutt Valley to the Maori Ancestry
        of Wainuiomata.

        <br />
        <br />The Matairangi Taumata is named after a legend of two taniwhas who
        tried to escape from Wellington harbour which used to be an enclosed
        lake. Maitairangi is a hill called Mount Victoria in Wellington. Its
        original name was Tangi Te Keo. One taniwha died and its spirit became a
        bird named Te Keo which flew to the top of this mountain and mourned
        which means Tangi.

        <br />
        <br />The Orongorongo Taumata is named after the Orongorongo valley and
        river in Wainuiomata. It is a shortened version of Te Tai O Rongorongo
        whichs means the water of Rongorongo who was the wife of Chief Turi
        Kaihautu. Rongo also means the Maori God of Agriculture. The River flows
        32km in the Southern Remutaka Ranges.
