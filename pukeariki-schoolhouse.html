    <p>
      Our taumata colour is purple with the emblem of a nikau palm . Pukeariki
      are the mountains on the West side of the Hutt Valley. The nikau palm
      starts as a small flax like palm and grows to a massive tree that does not
      resemble its original shape. Students at HVHS grow and overcome challenges
      as they learn. The soil that keep you standing is a representation of your
      family as they are the ones who keep you grounded, the sun that keeps you
      warm are your friends because they make you happy and keep you shining,
      the rain that keeps you hydrated and growing are your teachers watering
      you with knowledge and finally the emblem itself, represents you. You need
      all of these aspects to help you in life, your family friends teachers and
      even yourself, with these you will succeed in life and in school. You
      donâ€™t stop growing until you get to your peak, looking over those small
      things in life that you may have thought are difficult, but then soon
      realised you overcame it all.<br />

      <br />Core message - Growth through challenge.
