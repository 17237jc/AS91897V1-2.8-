      Our taumata colour is purple with the emblem of a nikau palm . Pukeariki are the mountains on the West side of the Hutt Valley. The nikau palm starts as a small flax like palm and grows to a massive tree that does not resemble its original shape. Students at HVHS grow and overcome challenges as they learn. The soil that keep you standing is a representation of your family as they are the ones who keep you grounded, the sun that keeps you warm are your friends because they make you happy and keep you shining, the rain that keeps you hydrated and growing are your teachers watering you with knowledge and finally the emblem itself, represents you. You need all of these aspects to help you in life, your family friends teachers and even yourself, with these you will succeed in life and in school. You donâ€™t stop growing until you get to your peak, looking over those small things in life that you may have thought are difficult, but then soon realised you overcame it all.<br>

<br>Core message - Growth through challenge.
