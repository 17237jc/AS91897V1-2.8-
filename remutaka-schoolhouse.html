     Welcome to Remutaka Taumata. Our house colour is green symbolising the lush greenery and life in the Remutaka Ranges with an emblem of a chief’s feathers. Haunuiananaia is an ancestor of the Te Ati Hau a Paparangi people of the Whanganui region. He left his home in southern Taranaki to explore and during his journey he sat down to rest on a mountain and to think about his quest. He named the mountain Remutaka – which means to sit down and rest. Hanuiananaia’s actions teach us the importance of taking risks and not being afraid to do so. Whether it be trying a new sport or club at school, we understand that both good and bad experiences bring wisdom and help us grow into better people. 
      <br>
      <br>Core message - Take a risk, reach for your goals.
